# 🤖 ReASK – AI Studio

### AI Agents, Chatbots & Automation Workflows for Crypto and Business

At **ReASK**, we build intelligent systems that **automate real-world tasks**, scale operations, and give teams superpowers. Whether you're in **crypto**, **web3**, or a traditional business — we design **AI agents**, **chatbots**, and **workflows** that actually do the work, not just chat.

## 💡 What We Build

- **Custom Chatbots** — Human-like assistants integrated with your product, docs, or internal tools.
- **AI Workflows** — Smart automations built with tools like **n8n**, **LangChain**, or **custom Python/Node.js stacks**.
- **Crypto-Native Tools** — On-chain watchers, trading copilots, DeFi agents, multisig monitors, and more.

- **Notion**, **Slack**, **Google Suite**

We believe in AI that's **practical**, **secure**, and **deeply useful**.

Let's build something intelligent — together.
